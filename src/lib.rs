//! [Google's Material Symbols](https://fonts.google.com/icons), as a font and as a type.
//!
//! One [`Icon`] per icon in the catalogue, so "which icons can I draw" is a question
//! autocomplete answers, and an icon that does not exist does not compile:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use pomelo_material_symbols::{self as icons, Icon};
//!
//! // once, where the program is built -- the platform installs what the settings carry:
//! iced::application(..).font(icons::FONT)
//!
//! // and then, anywhere:
//! text(Icon::WIFI.glyph()).font(icons::font()).size(20.0)
//! ```
//!
//! # What it is
//!
//! A pinned, instanced cut of Material Symbols Outlined, in the spirit of a `-sys` crate: the
//! font's bytes, the numbers that say which cut this is, and just enough Rust to name one icon.
//! The provenance is in `README.md`'s *Regenerating* section and the figures are in
//! `fonts/MANIFEST.md`; both are part of what this repository is for, because a font that cannot
//! say where it came from cannot be rebaked.
//!
//! # Why an icon is a glyph
//!
//! Because it is the one road that is already open. `pomelo-gfx` rasterises RGB565 images and
//! 8-bit alpha masks, but iced's renderer exposes neither to an app -- `allocate_image` answers
//! `Unsupported` and `geometry::draw_image` is empty -- and `Canvas::fill_path` only strokes an
//! outline, so an icon drawn as a *path* would not fill either. Glyphs, on the other hand, are a
//! road with traffic on it: the default font travels it, and so does every string in every app.
//!
//! So an icon is a character in the Private Use Area of a font that carries nothing else, and
//! drawing one is drawing text. Two conveniences fall out of that. Every icon is exactly one em
//! square -- the subset's `unitsPerEm` is 960 and so is every advance -- so `size(24.0)` draws a
//! 24×24 icon and `.size()` is the whole of the sizing story. And it is vector: one subset serves
//! 16 px and 96 px, with no bitmaps to rebake per size.
//!
//! # The whole catalogue, and what it costs
//!
//! Every icon Google ships is in the subset -- 4 299 of them -- so there is no list to keep up to
//! date and no rebake before an app can use an icon nobody has used yet. An unused [`Icon`] costs
//! nothing at all: each one is a `const`, and a `const` that nothing references is not emitted.
//! What is paid for, once, is the font: 1.1 MiB of flash (see `fonts/MANIFEST.md`), with no RAM
//! to match -- the bytes are borrowed out of `.rodata` rather than copied, because
//! `FontSystem::load_font` hands `fontdb` the `Cow` it was given.
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! * **No widgets.** [`Icon`] is data and [`FONT`] is bytes: no renderer, no platform, no
//!   `Element`. The things that build widgets are in `pomelo-widgets`.
//! * **No default font.** What text looks like when nobody asks is the platform's decision, and
//!   this font is never it: it is installed under its own family name, so nothing draws with it
//!   by accident. A `text(..)` that does not ask for [`font`] gets the platform's font as before.
//! * **No icon lists.** There is no `ALL`: a slice of 4 299 icons would reference every `const`
//!   and so emit them all, and nothing iterates the catalogue -- you name the icon you want.
